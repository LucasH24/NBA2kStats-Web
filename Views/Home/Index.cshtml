<h1> Welcome to 2k-Stats </h1>

<h5> This is a personal website to track my NBA2k stats </h5>
<h5> You can view series stats, season stats, and use the stat view feature to see all the data </h5>
<h5> I would like to do a lot more with this data but unfortuantely the data the game provides is lackluster </h5>
<h5> This website is designed for PC use, I am working on a companion app for mobile </h5>
